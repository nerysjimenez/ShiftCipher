     This Shift Cipher algorithm uses the modulo operator to encrypt messages.
     The Shift Cipher has a key k, which is an integer from 0 to 25.
     This key is shared only with people that we want to see our message.
     
     ShiftCipher.java asks the user for two inputs a key and a plain text message.
     The program outputs the encrypted message.
